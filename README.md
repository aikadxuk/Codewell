# Codewell
My first test-site made using Codewell activity
I've been studying webdesign since 3 months, and I tried to make this Codewell activity
Some codes can be wrong but I tried to make using all the knowledge that learned until now
You can view my code,judge and show me what I can get better or using it for anything,
all the design,images,etc. are inside the folders in this repository
Keep following and Thanks
P.S:Sorry my bad english,I'm still studying it ; )

I created a tablet (768px) and a smartphone (400px) version with its hamburguer with mobile navigation inside on this
Enjoy my code ;)
